title: Reinterpretation of the crazy ATLAS analysis
pubkey: 'cds/1525880'
request_format: 'okcheck'
description: >
  this model adds some particles and parameters
reason: >
  the original analysis only investigates simplified models. The
  branching ratio of this particular complete model into the
  studied topologies is quite small, so it would be interesting
  to understand what the true exlusions are.
additional_information: >
  the most interesting points are the ones attached. Possibly this
  scan could be extended in case the sensitivity is higher than
  expected.
